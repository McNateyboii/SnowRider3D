If you are hosting this game (e.g. for school), you might want to enable password protection.
Very nice if you want to keep every single person at your school from using it and getting it blocked.
It is very simple and won't keep anyone with moderate coding experience from bypassing, but is still very useful.
This is how to enable:
In index.html, you can change the variables of line 18 and 19 to enable the password.
Set 'const ENABLE_PASSWORD' line 18) to 1 to enable the password, and set 'const PASSWORD' (line 19) to whatever you want your password to be. Default is 1234
